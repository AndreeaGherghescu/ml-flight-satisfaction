# ml-flight-satisfaction

One of the main goals of airline companies is to retain existing customers and attract new ones by continuously improving the quality of their services. Passenger satisfaction depends on numerous factors, from the airport experience to in-flight services, punctuality, and the off boarding process.

This project focuses on classifying airline passengers as either satisfied or unsatisfied based on various aspects of their journey. The analysis is based on a survey dataset that includes features such as travel class, type of travel, flight delays, onboard services, and demographic information. 

The workflow involves preprocessing of the dataset, data mining for gathering insights and understanding the context, and modeling and comparing various classifiers to identify the most capable to distinguish between satisfied and unsatisfied passengers.
